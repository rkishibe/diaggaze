The dataset currently contains 547 images. The default image dimension was set as 640x480. The dataset is organized into two main folders as: i) Images, and ii) Metadata. The ‘Images’ folder contains two subfolders as: i) ‘TCImages’ (i.e. Non-ASD), and ii) ‘TSImages’ (i.e. ASD). Specifically, 328 images for the non-ASD participants, and 219 for the ASD-diagnosed participants.

Furthermore, a set of metadata files is included. One metadata file, named Metadata_Participants.csv, is used to describe the key characteristics of participants (e.g. gender, age, CARS). Every participant is also assigned a unique ID. Two more metadata files are used to maintain the mapping of image files to participants. For further usability, the metadata is entirely provided in a single JSON-formatted file.

The image files are also named in a way to help infer the class and ID of participants. We followed a consistent naming format as ‘Class_ParticipantID’. For instance, TC002_39.png denotes that it is an image belonging to a TC-participant whose ID is 39.

We refer to the two classes as follows:
TS --> ASD-Diagnosed
TC --> Non-ASD
